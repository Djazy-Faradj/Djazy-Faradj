## 🚀 Projects 

Here are some of the cool things I've been working on:

### 🧑‍💻 HR Management App
A **mini project** focused on building a **Human Resource Management** app. This app allows HR professionals to manage employee and department data, job roles, and other essential HR tasks in a simple interface.
- **Tech stack**: C++
- Features:
  - Employee profile management
  - Role assignments and payroll tracking
  - Basic reporting and data export

### 🔍 QR Code Reader
A challenging personal project where I developed a QR code reader from scratch without using existing QR reading libraries. The project processes the QR code image using **Pillow** and decodes the data based on its format and error correction levels.
- **Tech stack**: Python, Pillow
  
### 🎮 Minigame Mania
A fast-paced mobile game inspired by Nintendo’s WarioWare franchise, built using the **Godot Game Engine**. It features a series of mini-games, each designed to be quick and fun. Currently playable but still adding the final touches.
- **Tech stack**: Godot, GDScript

### 🧠 Image Classification with Python
Built a **28x28 image classification model** using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. This project helped me dive deeper into machine learning and image recognition.
- **Tech stack**: Python, Keras, TensorFlow

### 🧑‍💼 CustomMessages Minecraft Plugin
One of my earliest projects! I developed this [Minecraft server plugin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/privatemessages) at the age of 12, and it's still out there with a solid number of downloads. Revisiting this plugin always gives me a sense of pride.
- **Tech stack**: Java

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I'm constantly learning new things! Some of the areas I'm diving deeper into include:
- Advanced concepts in **machine learning**
- Enhancing my knowledge of **web development frameworks**
- Exploring **engineering ethics** and the professional responsibilities of engineers
- Enhancing my knowledge of **mathematics for engineers**, including topics like discrete mathematics, and differential equations
- Enhancing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms through **leetcode problems**
